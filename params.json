  "body": "### About Me.\r\nI am an Assistant Professor in the [Linguistics Department](http://linguistics.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/).\r\nBetween 2009 and 2012, I was an assistant professor at the [City University of New York](http://www2.cuny.edu/). I held a joint appointment between the [English department](http://www.csi.cuny.edu/catalog/undergraduate/departments/englishspeechworldlit.html) at the [College of Staten Island](http://www.csi.cuny.edu/) and the [Linguistics program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Linguistics) at the [Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home).\r\nI graduated from the [Linguistics department](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in August of 2009. My dissertation is titled _A Probabilistic Model of Phonological Relationships from Contrast to Allophony_.\r\nPlease follow the links below to find out more about my research, teaching, and personal interests.\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\nE-mail: kathleen.hall@ubc.ca\r\n\r\nDepartment of Linguistics\r\n\r\nTotem Field Studios, Rm. 125\r\n\r\nUniversity of British Columbia\r\n\r\n2613 West Mall\r\n\r\nVancouver, BC  V6T 1Z4\r\n\r\nCanada\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nMy research focuses on answering questions in theoretical phonology using techniques from a wide variety of areas, including experimental phonetics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, semantics, and information theory.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of questions I am interested in are:\r\n* what discrete categories of sound do language users extract from a continuous acoustic signal?\r\n* what relationships may hold between these sound categories in a given language?\r\n* how are these relationships determined?\r\n* what patterns and processes apply to these categories?\r\n* what linguistic information do these categories convey?\r\n* how do language learners acquire these categories?\r\n* to what extent are these categories, relationships, and processes psychologically real?\r\n* what cognitive processes have led to these categories, relationships, and processes?\r\n* how can these categories, relationships, and processes be modelled in an objective and predictive way?\r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\nIn the fall of 2016 (2016 Winter Term 1 at UBC), I am teaching the following classes:\r\n\r\n* Stat 203 -- Statistical Methods -- I am teaching the Linguistics / Speech Sciences tutorial section (T1D); the main course instructor is Bruce Dunham.  The course website is [www.slate.stat.ubc.ca](www.slate.stat.ubc.ca)\r\n\r\n* Ling 200 -- Linguistic Theory & Analysis I\r\n\r\nMy office hours for this semester are:\r\n* 11:00 -- 12:00 on Tuesdays, Room 5, Stores Rd. Annex\r\n* 12:00 -- 1:00 on Wednesdays, Room 5, Stores Rd. Annex\r\n* 12:00 -- 1:00 on Thursdays, Room 5, Stores Rd. Annex\r\n* By appointment in Totem Field Studios, Rm. 125\r\n\r\n### Letters of Reference\r\nI am often happy to provide letters of reference for students, but please keep in mind the following pointers:\r\n\r\n* You should ask for a letter of reference only from someone who knows you reasonably well and can write excellent things about you. Letters are taken quite seriously by most programs, and even a \"good\" letter that simply replicates information that someone could learn from your transcript and CV (e.g., stating that you get good grades and have XYZ experience) is likely to do you a _disservice_ rather than a service, as it will make it sound like there isn't anything better to say.\r\n\r\n* Therefore, if you plan to ask me for a letter, you should make a point of making yourself personally known to me throughout the time you are in my course. Introduce yourself, come to office hours, send me e-mails, etc. Help me get to know you and see that you are a bright, talented, dedicated individual, so that I can convey that in a letter. (You should of course be doing this anyway if you want to be an excellent student!)\r\n\r\n* Personally, I require that I have had you in class for an entire semester (including the final exam / paper) before I will even consider writing a letter of reference for you. I prefer to have had you for a student for longer than that, but that is the minimum for me to be able to say anything meaningful about you.\r\n\r\n* When you ask for a letter, please don't assume that the answer will be \"yes.\" If I don't think it's in _your_ best interests for me to write you a letter, I won't do it, and begging me to reconsider is likely to make things worse.\r\n\r\n* If I agree to write you a letter or letters, please download [this form](http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/kchall/kchall/Teaching_files/Blank_form_for_letter_requests.doc), fill out the requested information, and compile the requested materials, at least two weeks before the letter is due.\r\n\r\n* If you are asking for multiple letters at the same time, please provide a summary page that lists all of the programs you are applying to, and their due dates, in chronological order. Please don't be afraid to ask for multiple letters of recommendation -- once I have written one, it's much easier to write others for additional programs.\r\n\r\n* Please check back in with me if I have agreed to write a letter and you haven't heard anything. If, for example, you haven't heard from me that I have submitted the letter, and there's only a week left before it's due, *please* send me an e-mail asking if I have submitted it because it's due in a week!\r\n\r\n* Finally: Please keep me informed of your progress! If I'm writing you a letter of reference, it means that I think you are an excellent student and am taking the time to try to help you succeed. Please let me know whether you've been accepted into a program and/or what your future plans are!\r\n\r\n### Presentations / Publications \r\n\r\nFor a complete list of my presentations and publications, please [see my CV](). \r\n\r\nTo gain access to specific materials mentioned, please [go to my Academia.edu page]().\r\n\r\n### _Phonological CorpusTools_\r\n\r\nAlong with a team of RAs, I have created free, open-source software to aid in doing phonological analysis on corpora. You can download the software, feature files, and userâ€™s manual for PCT on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/PhonologicalCorpusTools/CorpusTools/releases). See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlYmtZL7m2o) for an overview of the software, and [this page](http://corpustools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the complete documentation.",
