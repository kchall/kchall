<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://linguistics.ubc.ca/">Linguistics Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>.
Between 2009 and 2012, I was an assistant professor at the <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/">City University of New York</a>. I held a joint appointment between the <a href="http://www.csi.cuny.edu/catalog/undergraduate/departments/englishspeechworldlit.html">English department</a> at the <a href="http://www.csi.cuny.edu/">College of Staten Island</a> and the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Linguistics">Linguistics program</a> at the <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home">Graduate Center</a>.
I graduated from the <a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/">Linguistics department</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a> in August of 2009. My dissertation is titled <em>A Probabilistic Model of Phonological Relationships from Contrast to Allophony</em>.

<a id="research" class="anchor" href="#research" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h1>

<p>My research focuses on answering questions in theoretical phonology using techniques from a wide variety of areas, including experimental phonetics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, semantics, and information theory.</p>

<p>The kinds of questions I am interested in are:</p>

<ul>
<li>what discrete categories of sound do language users extract from a continuous acoustic signal?</li>
<li>what relationships may hold between these sound categories in a given language?</li>
<li>how are these relationships determined?</li>
<li>what patterns and processes apply to these categories?</li>
<li>what linguistic information do these categories convey?</li>
<li>how do language learners acquire these categories?</li>
<li>to what extent are these categories, relationships, and processes psychologically real?</li>
<li>what cognitive processes have led to these categories, relationships, and processes?</li>
<li>how can these categories, relationships, and processes be modelled in an objective and predictive way?</li>
</ul>

<a id="letters-of-reference" class="anchor" href="#letters-of-reference" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Letters of Reference</h3>

<p>I am often happy to provide letters of reference for students, but please keep in mind the following pointers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You should ask for a letter of reference only from someone who knows you reasonably well and can write excellent things about you. Letters are taken quite seriously by most programs, and even a "good" letter that simply replicates information that someone could learn from your transcript and CV (e.g., stating that you get good grades and have XYZ experience) is likely to do you a <em>disservice</em> rather than a service, as it will make it sound like there isn't anything better to say.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, if you plan to ask me for a letter, you should make a point of making yourself personally known to me throughout the time you are in my course. Introduce yourself, come to office hours, send me e-mails, etc. Help me get to know you and see that you are a bright, talented, dedicated individual, so that I can convey that in a letter. (You should of course be doing this anyway if you want to be an excellent student!)</p></li>
<li><p>Personally, I require that I have had you in class for an entire semester (including the final exam / paper) before I will even consider writing a letter of reference for you. I prefer to have had you for a student for longer than that, but that is the minimum for me to be able to say anything meaningful about you.</p></li>
<li><p>When you ask for a letter, please don't assume that the answer will be "yes." If I don't think it's in <em>your</em> best interests for me to write you a letter, I won't do it, and begging me to reconsider is likely to make things worse.</p></li>
<li><p>If I agree to write you a letter or letters, please download <a href="http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/kchall/kchall/Teaching_files/Blank_form_for_letter_requests.doc">this form</a>, fill out the requested information, and compile the requested materials, at least two weeks before the letter is due.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are asking for multiple letters at the same time, please provide a summary page that lists all of the programs you are applying to, and their due dates, in chronological order. Please don't be afraid to ask for multiple letters of recommendation -- once I have written one, it's much easier to write others for additional programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Please check back in with me if I have agreed to write a letter and you haven't heard anything. If, for example, you haven't heard from me that I have submitted the letter, and there's only a week left before it's due, <em>please</em> send me an e-mail asking if I have submitted it because it's due in a week!</p></li>
<li><p>Finally: Please keep me informed of your progress! If I'm writing you a letter of reference, it means that I think you are an excellent student and am taking the time to try to help you succeed. Please let me know whether you've been accepted into a program and/or what your future plans are!</p></li>

<p>Along with a team of RAs, I have created free, open-source software to aid in doing phonological analysis on corpora. You can download the software, feature files, and userâ€™s manual for PCT on the <a href="https://github.com/PhonologicalCorpusTools/CorpusTools/releases">GitHub release page</a>. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlYmtZL7m2o">this video</a> for an overview of the software, and <a href="http://corpustools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">this page</a> for the complete documentation.</p>
